Description:

This code converts a datetime string from one timezone to another timezone and prints the result in the desired format.

Dependencies:

This code requires the following dependencies:

datetime
pytz

Working Process:

The code imports the datetime and pytz modules. datetime module provides classes for working with dates and times and pytz module provides timezone support for Python.

The datetime string to be converted is assigned to the datetime_str variable.

The datetime_str is parsed into a datetime object using the strptime() method from the datetime module. The format of the input string is specified as %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S, where %Y represents the year, %m represents the month, %d represents the day, %H represents the hour, %M represents the minute, and %S represents the second.

The timezone of the datetime object is set using the localize() method from the pytz module. The original_timezone variable specifies the timezone of the datetime string. In this case, the timezone is set to US/Pacific.

The datetime object is then converted to a different timezone using the astimezone() method. The target_timezone variable specifies the timezone to which the datetime should be converted. In this case, the timezone is set to Asia/Kolkata.

Finally, the code prints the converted datetime string in the desired format. The strftime() method from the datetime module is used to format the datetime object as a string. The format string "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z" specifies the desired format, where %Z represents the timezone abbreviation and %z represents the timezone offset from UTC.

The output of the code is the converted datetime string in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TimezoneAbbreviation +/-HHMM, where TimezoneAbbreviation is the abbreviation for the target timezone and +/-HHMM is the offset from UTC.
