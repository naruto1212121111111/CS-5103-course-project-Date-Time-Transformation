# CS-5103-Course-Project-Date-Time_transformation
In this Project we are writing a program to transform a one format to another format(which we add day in between the format)
Here I have 2 files for printing the particular format.
date_timezone.py - This transforms the particular timezone in the specified format(11/02/2023 Thursday 05:00)and has the daylight saving requirement.
test_your_code.py - In this file it has different types of test cases for the file .
Running the program in vs code:
first download and insert the file in vscode and run date_timezone.py file using command python3 date_timezone.py it shows the output in the specified format.
After that the test_your_code.py test cases file using command python3 test_your_code.py it shows the testcases and their output for different timezones in the specified format.
